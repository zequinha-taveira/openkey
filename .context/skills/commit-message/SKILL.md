## Workflow

1. Review the staged changes using `git diff --staged`
2. Identify the type of change (feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore)
3. Determine the scope (component, module, or area affected)
4. Write a concise subject line (50 chars max, imperative mood)
5. Add body if needed to explain "why" not "what"
6. Reference issue numbers if applicable

## Examples

**Feature commit:**
```
feat(auth): add password reset functionality

Implement forgot password flow with email verification.
Users can now reset their password via email link.

Closes #123
```

**Bug fix commit:**
```
fix(api): handle null response in user lookup

Previously threw TypeError when user not found.
Now returns 404 with appropriate error message.

Fixes #456
```

## Quality Bar

- Use imperative mood: "add" not "added" or "adds"
- Keep subject line under 50 characters
- Separate subject from body with blank line
- Use body to explain why, not what (code shows what)
- Reference issues with "Closes #X" or "Fixes #X"
- One logical change per commit
- Don't end subject line with period

## Resource Strategy

- Add `scripts/` only when the task is fragile, repetitive, or benefits from deterministic execution.
- Add `references/` only when details are too large or too variant-specific to keep in `SKILL.md`.
- Add `assets/` only for files that will be consumed in the final output.
- Keep extra docs out of the skill folder; prefer `SKILL.md` plus only the resources that materially help.

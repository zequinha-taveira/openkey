# Skills

On-demand expertise for AI agents. Skills are task-specific procedures that get activated when relevant.

> Project: openkey

## How Skills Work

1. **Discovery**: AI agents discover available skills
2. **Matching**: When a task matches a skill's description, it's activated
3. **Execution**: The skill's instructions guide the AI's behavior

| [Security Audit](./security-audit/SKILL.md) | Review code and infrastructure for security weaknesses. Use when Reviewing code for security vulnerabilities, Assessing authentication/authorization, or Checking for OWASP top 10 issues | R, V |
| [dotcontext-workflow](./dotcontext-workflow/SKILL.md) | Operate PREVC workflow through any adapter (MCP, CLI, hooks, Pi) | P, R, E, V, C |
| [dotcontext-tooling](./dotcontext-tooling/SKILL.md) | When to use harness actions (init, guide, advance, manage, sensors) across any adapter | P, R, E, V, C |
| [dotcontext-workflow-p](./dotcontext-workflow-p/SKILL.md) | PREVC phase P (Planning) checklist for harness-backed work | P |
| [dotcontext-workflow-r](./dotcontext-workflow-r/SKILL.md) | PREVC phase R (Review) checklist for harness-backed work | R |
| [dotcontext-workflow-e](./dotcontext-workflow-e/SKILL.md) | PREVC phase E (Execution) checklist for harness-backed work | E |
| [dotcontext-workflow-v](./dotcontext-workflow-v/SKILL.md) | PREVC phase V (Validation) checklist for harness-backed work | V |
| [dotcontext-workflow-c](./dotcontext-workflow-c/SKILL.md) | PREVC phase C (Confirmation) checklist for harness-backed work | C |

## Creating Custom Skills

Create a new skill by adding a directory with a `SKILL.md` file:

```
.context/skills/
└── my-skill/
    ├── SKILL.md          # Required: source skill definition
    ├── scripts/          # Optional: deterministic helpers
    ├── references/       # Optional: load-on-demand details
    └── assets/           # Optional: output resources
```

### Skill Anatomy

```md
The source file under `.context/skills/` keeps internal scaffold metadata so dotcontext can track fill status.
When exported to AI-tool skill directories, the portable frontmatter should keep only:

---
name: my-skill
description: Describe what the skill does and the concrete triggers for when to use it
---

## Workflow
1. Step one
2. Step two

## Examples
```
[Short example]
```

## Quality Bar
- List the checks and constraints that keep the skill reliable

## Resource Strategy
- Explain when to add `scripts/`, `references/`, or `assets/`
```

Keep activation language in the description frontmatter, keep the body concise, and avoid extra docs such as `README.md` or `CHANGELOG.md` inside the skill folder.

## PREVC Phase Mapping

| Phase | Name | Skills |
|-------|------|--------|
| P | Planning | feature-breakdown, documentation, api-design |
| R | Review | pr-review, code-review, api-design, security-audit |
| E | Execution | commit-message, test-generation, refactoring, bug-investigation |
| V | Validation | pr-review, code-review, test-generation, security-audit |
| C | Confirmation | commit-message, documentation |
